# My Own Static Site Generator, the beginning

After a long hiatus, I decided to revamp my old websites, including my
homepage and my old blog.

For the homepage I didn't use any content management system at all, I just made
everything by hand (mind you, I basically did start in the middle of the 90s,
and then carried it on from there). For the blog, which I started in 2008, I
did use WordPress.

Dear reader, I cannot recommend WordPress.

A short while ago, the server running my blog (on WordPress) was shut down,
so I had to move my blog to another server (or delete it, but I am very
keen on keeping all links on the web alive).

And while I was at it, I wanted to get rid of WordPress. I didn't want to
blow new life into the blog, just to keep it up. Therefore things like
comment pages etc. were not important to me. So I decided to switch to
a static site generator.

A quick survey led me to Hugo. Some people had bad things to say about Hugo,
but I wanted to try it anyway.

Dear reader, I cannot recommend Hugo.

Granted, Hugo is definitely an improvement to WordPress, but keep in mind that
they do very different things. At least with Hugo you don't have to worry
about security as much.

My main gripe with Hugo is overburdening complexity in combination with a lot
of questionable design decisions. Things that should be easy are quite hard.

So I thought, why don't I make my own static site generator? How hard could
it be?

Dear reader, I cannot recommend &hellip;

&hellip; well, I don't know yet.

I want to build something that matches exactly my needs, and if it meets
also your needs, dear reader, you are very much welcome to use it.

But I need something to use it for, in order to find out what my needs are.

So I decided to overhaul my old homepage.

And while I am at it, I can also write about it, so that others can take 
pleasure in watching my toils (and to honor Patrick McKenzie, who wrote
"If you do something, write about it, it's the best advertising for your
abilities" &ndash; well, that is heavily paraphrased, but I'm sure he
wrote something along those lines).

So, this is going to turn into a series of articles which I'll publish
on my homepage (not the old, defunct blog; after all, I'm revamping my
homepage with this project).
